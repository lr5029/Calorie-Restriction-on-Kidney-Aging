# Calorie-Restriction-on-Kidney-Aging
### Packages Used in the scope of the Project
- library(Seurat)
- library(dplyr)
- library(Matrix)
- library(patchwork)
- library(devtools)
- library(perturb.met)
- library(scMCA)

### Area of Interest
- sex difference within the same cell type. E.g., in cluster 1, compare M-O vs. F-O number of cell for each cluster
- age effects on metabolism: E.g., M-O vs. M-Y
- calorie restriction on metabolism: E.g., M-CR vs. M-O. 
- compound effects of calorie restriction (maybe it does not work the same way for female vs. male): comparing the results of M-CR vs. M-O with F-CR vs. F-O.
